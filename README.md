This is a simple parser implemented in C++ that can handle various data types and basic control structures. The lexer tokenizes the source code, and the parser validates the syntax.

# Features
- Tokenization of data types: int, float, double, string, bool, char
- Support for control structures: if, else, while, for
- Error handling for unexpected tokens and unterminated strings
